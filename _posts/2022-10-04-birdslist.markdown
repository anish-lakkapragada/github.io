## Bird Background 

For the last year, I've gone outside and taken photos of specifically birds (yes those things) in my backyard, neighborhood, and local parks and forests. It's pretty fun and one of the bird things I've always wanted to do is to maintain a list of all the bird's I've photographed (the second is to make a tier list).

So here goes nothing. 

## Birds Photographed
- California Scrub Jay 
- Lesser Goldfinch 
- Black Phoebe
- House Finch 
- Western Bluebird
- American Robin 
- Dark-eyed Junco
- California Towhee
- Mourning Dove
- White-crowned sparrow
- Gold-crowned sparrow
- American Robin 
- Barn Swallow
- Yellow-rumped warbler
- Anna's Hummingbird
- Bald Eagle
- Pine Siskin
- American Tree Sparrow
- Brown-headed cowbird
- Tree Swallow
- Acorn Woodpecker
- Brewer's Blackbird

I probably should separate these into groups sooner or later.
