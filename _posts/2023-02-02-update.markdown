> This article was made at 2am. I will update as I become more aware of my own observations and discover more. 

It's been a while since I've posted and I figure I should. I've made a series of observations in my life which are undoubtedly true (I may be biased ;) but generally seem to prove themselves true time and time again. Whether that is a self-fulfilling prophecy of me believing in my own BS, I do not know. 

## Experiences Can Not Be Repeated Twice 

I remember when I was younger, visiting a beach in Europe. It was pretty fun to be in the waves and all day. The next day, I wanted to have exactly what I had yesterday - a nice day on the sand - but the tides were going crazy and the weather was cloudy and gloomy. From that experience in itself around ~7 years ago, I've come to realize that any memory cannot be repeated more than once. Time is a monotonically increasing function - you cannot go back - to the first time you listented to your favorite song, read your favorite book, or had a genuinely good time. 

What this implies is the idea of *living in the moment* as being necessary to experience life better. If we are having a fun, spontaneous time, we have to be smart enough to realize that 1) we are having fun and that 2) this time will never come again in its pure, natural form and thus the best thing that can be done is to make it the best time of our lives. If this seems too idealistic for you, here's a simpler one - just next time you find a song that hits your ears in a nice way just try to listen to that song only because the pleasure you get from its novelties, unexpected beats, etc. will die with each listen. 

## Useful vs. Useless Arguments

Today, I remember seeing an argument about who was the most oppressed/privileged/etc. demographic throughout history. This may seem obvious, but regardless of how won - there would be no real winner because they are really just fighting for approval over an opinion not over policy. Useless arguments argue over opinions, useful arguments argue over policy. Try to aim for useful arguments. 

## Implicit Order of the World 

For this mysterious thing called *prestige*, there seems to be an implicit order of the world. The world is full of diverse people yet at the same time follows predictable, statistically-significant patterns en masse: students offered a selection of universities generally choose some over others, certain countries are seen as just "better" (e.g. America) despite growing bodies of evidence saying anything but. Rankings for companies change yearly and yet the same implicit order of which companies are more prestigious stay - there is a general inertia for learnt rankings to change when they are founded on unstated social assumptions and not facts. 

## Things are more deterministic than we realize 

My desk right now is an absolute mess. It is completely disorganized and there are random pens everywhere. I can't even tell you how I got to this state. But it is deterministc. When I search for something, like a pen, that I will inevitably lose in this mess, I can guarantee I will try to search for multiple different locations. This is fine, but it's better for me to realize there's a reason why it's the place it is beyond the fact that I "lost" it. The principle that things are the way they are for a reason (deterministic in machine learning) is an interesting one. It's also why I love APLAC - reading masterpieces where every word was chosen deliberately means that there is a neverending supply of critical thinking and digging to be done. 

## Your Music Taste Is Not (Really) Unique

(Might just be me.) I am always hungry about songs. It is always super funny to see how an unfamiliar song with a slightly weird name but a lot of streams slowly goes from something I completely don't resonate or feel is part of my taste to my playlist. Time and time again, I have seen that whatever my initial reaction to the song - *I am not unique* - I probably will find myself liking it. This means that I should try to explore different genres and not judge.
