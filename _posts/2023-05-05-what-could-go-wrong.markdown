## Purpose

A lot of times in our life, we reflect more on what isn't going well and not what is. It may feel like everything fails at the worst moment - however, we rarely acknowledge all the things that did go well, or by contrast worked and did not succeed. For example, during a test we will underestimate how many we got wrong because we spent so much more time on questions we didn't know the answer to. Part of this makes sense though - we expect staples to staples in them, computers to charge when we plug them in, and phones to work (we expect things to work.)

In light of this idea of _gratitude_, one idea I had was to keep a rolling list of all the things I've seen that have luckily gone in a favorable direction. That way, I'll pay more attention to what is working than just what isn't.
