Here's a list of philosophies to go over. Mostly just so I remember what they mean.

## Solipsism

We will never know if we see the world in the same way. Meaning, are our colors the same? My pink could be your green and your green could be my pink. Do we really taste food the same way?

In short, beyond ourselves, we can't really think further about what is real. We all mutually agree that the leaves are green, but what if it's objectively blue but we all say that it's green because green to us is blue.

This is where science comes into play. While wavelengths do exist to scientifically explain different colors or pH scales measuring acidity - I'm reminded of the dragon in _Grendel_ reprimanding humans for overgeneralization of observations made in an inconsequential amount of time. Like a 2D-seeing deer that can't recognize the car approaching it, we could be failing to recognize that these easily distinguishable properties between the colors of leaves or tastes of food comes from the simplicity of a 3D view of a potentially âˆž-d world. In other words, everything could be an illusion.

What we only know to be true is that we exist and our perception of reality. That's _solipsism_.
