~~It's been a minute since I've updated this thing.~~ Today I woke up with a pretty fun dream. I found a secret part of my high school filled with California Scrub-Jays (my favorite bird :D) and rushed to take photographs of them. On that note, why not write an article on my observations and techniques for photographing birds Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

## Common Reason for Failed Photographs

Leaves. Branches. More leaves. Half the time these things become the area of focus for my camera lens instead of the fast-moving birds I am going to capture. Therefore, always try to find a clearing or area where no leaves/branches are in front of the bird (in the background as scenery is not a problem).

Another common reason for a bird photograph is cause the bird flies off. Here's how to avoid that.

## How To Prevent The Bird From Flying Off

To some extent, the motions of a bird are out of control. However, simple things like not talking near the bird or not making too loud steps are controllable. Only approach a still bird further _after_ taking a photograph of it. It doesn't make sense to give up your guaranteed picture in hopes of a more close-up picture.

Avoid shaking the branches of the bird either as that tends to make the birds go away. Of course, this stuff all sounds obvious but I'm not lying when I say there is a spidey sense to know when a bird will disappear a split-second before it happens.

## What makes a good bird photograph?

I'm not the best in photographing these creatures but the main thing I've noticed is that having the face (and both eyes) is extremely crucial. We look at bird photographs somewhat in the same way as humans. Having as much focus on the bird's face - and the emotion created by the bird's hopeful glance as it turns its head - is extremely important.

## Why Bird Photography is Enjoyable

Bird photography (at least for an amateur like me) is a little bit like monopoly. There's undeniable skill, but undeniable luck as well. Sometimes I get multiple of my best photographs ever from one trip (Alaska ðŸ‘€) and sometimes return borderline empty-handed. But there are things to improve upon - better aim of the camera, the ability to recognize birds faster, being able to shift lens focus in a split-second, knowing which birds show when - there is a reason we have photographs like [these](https://images.theoutdoorwire.com/2019/12/04/45d848cc-63f8-43ae-8692-f47e960cfc54_600x476.jpg).

Furthermore observing birds as they hop around free while you stress about APLAC is oddly annoying and reassuring at the same time.

## Conclusion

It's not as boring as it sounds. Also peep the amateur [field guide](/notes/bay-area-birds-field-guide.pdf) I made for Bay Area birds.
