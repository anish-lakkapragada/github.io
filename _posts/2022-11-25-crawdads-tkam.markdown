**Keywords: Random, Thanksgiving Movie**

This thanksgiving I watched the movie _Where The Crawdads Sing_ with my family. As I was watching the suspenseful murder mystery, I had a suspicion that I made very well known to the 3 people around me that the book was very similar and related to _To Kill a Mockingbird_. I searched up if anybody else had drew the parallels and sure enough they had.

Regardless, here are all the parallels I could draw.

## Setting

This is by far the most obvious. _Where The Crawdads Sing_ and _To Kill a Mockingbird_ were both set in the small, Southern towns during the 1960s. Both of them focus on the general idea of an outcast (more on this later) among a judgemental post-slavery society, albeit _To Kill a Mockingbird_'s much more defined focus on racism.

## Similar Elements

### Schooling

Both _To Kill a Mockingbird_ and _Where The Crawdads Sing_ depict on the impoverished conditions of American education. _To Kill a Mockingbird_ shows Dill, a poor child attending school who cannot afford school lunch, and _Where The Crawdads Sing_ depicts Kya being teased as a poor rat when walking into the public school barefoot. Both of them show the low education standards and high poverty present even among whites in the South at the time.

### Racism

_To Kill a Mockingbird_ is the most directly focused on racism and is even thought to be modeled after the Scottsboro's trial case. _Where the Crawdads Sing_ is less explicit but racism is clearly visible when the private inspectors call the African-American store owner, Jumpin, "boy" (derogatory term for African Americans during slavery era.)

### Outsiders

Prejudice against "outsiders" from a judgemental town are at the essence of both stories. In _To Kill a Mockingbird_, the outsider is Boo Radley who is believed to be a ghost by the gossip of the town and Scout herself. In _Where the Crawdads Sing_, the same outlandish judgement is given to Kya, better known to the town as the mysterious "Marsh Girl." While a trial for Radley is never conducted, it is discussed towards the end as something that would hurt him in the same way as would a trial of Chase's rape of Kya.

### Trial Case

This is by far the most obvious. Both _To Kill a Mockingbird_ and _Where the Crawdads Sing_ are stories of the trial which unreveal uglier realities. The only difference in this case is that Kya, the one on trial, was actually guilty and not charged compared to Tom Robinson.

### Nature

For crying out loud, _Where the Crawdads Sing_ and _To Kill a Mockingbird_ both have birds in their names! Beyond that _Where the Crawdads Sing_ is very focused on the deep interest of Kya in the nature and the world around her. _To Kill a Mockingbird_ also has similar attention to nature with the bird imagery of "Finch" (an actual bird) all being birds, and the overall concept of birds not doing anything harmful in this world.

## Which one is better?

I'm not in a position to judge but _To Kill a Mockingbird_ definitely seems better. Perhaps because I spent half a semester reading it and not a night watching it.
