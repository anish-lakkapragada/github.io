A famous quote I've remembered for the last four years goes something like this:

> If a book even has a few words of literary gold, it's worth rereading the entire thing.

Recently, I've been thinking about how many songs I listen to just for a few seconds - a tone change, a beat switch, etc.
And how much do those seconds take up of the entire song?

Even further, is it better if they take up less seconds (so that I don't get bored of them as much), or do I want these timespans of joy to be longer because well ... they are nice to listen?

I don't have an answer (yet). So, as a reasonable excuse to procrastinate on deliberating this question, I hope you enjoy/utilize my offering of the musical golden seconds I listen to in some of my favorite songs.

## Original Question

First of: yes, they did all have Drake in them.

Based on this song sample (which came straight from memory, so probably not super representative), it looks like shorter time frames almost always lead to stronger moments than those longer.
