A famous quote I've remembered for the last four years goes something like this:

> If a book even has a few words of literary gold, it's worth rereading the entire thing.

Recently, I've been thinking about how many songs I listen to just for a few seconds - a tone change, a beat switch, etc.
And how much do those seconds take up of the entire song?

Even further, is it better if they take up less seconds (so that I don't get bored of them as much), or do I want these timespans of joy to be longer because well ... they are nice to listen?

I don't have an answer (yet). So, as a reasonable excuse to procrastinate on deliberating this question, I hope you accept my offering of a lot of songs I listen to and those musically gold seconds worth listening to. It's also a good excuse for me to revisit my favorite songs.
