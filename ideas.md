There's a list of ideas that fascinate me and that I'm looking to write about soon, or have already.

Here's a few of them.

- How everyone's life is infinitely different but ultimately the same
- How the value of a happy memory grows over time
- The fact that we experience time only as an increasing dimension
- [The importance of things I'll forget](/jekyll/update/2023/07/21/hardquestions)
