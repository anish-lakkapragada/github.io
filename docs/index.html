<blockquote>
  <p>disclaimer: i am a drake stan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>trigger warnings: Drake, album</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

<p>Not a bad album. I’ll repeat that again. Not a bad album.</p>

<p>Obviously, don’t expect another <em>Nothing Was The Same</em> and <em>Take Care</em> to get dropped by the 6 God, but don’t dismiss another solid album either. The album carries the same angry tone from Drizzy’s previous <em>Her Loss</em> album with a fair share of emotional tracks as well. Does it sound as reflective as his past works? No. Is it passable? More than so.</p>

<h2 id="lack-of-changes">Lack of Changes</h2>

<p>That being said, the album doesn’t come with a whole lot of changes. His style of complaining, crooning, denigrating, and out-of-pocket lyrics haven’t gone anywhere. It just feels like a natural extension of the angry tones on <em>Her Loss</em> with the perceived absurdity/memery of <em>Certified Lover Boy</em>. Personally, I find nothing wrong with sticking to one what knows, but the internet seems to have higher standards for him. Granted, he is in the top 3 (conservatively top 7) rappers of all time.</p>

<p>In particular, Drake got a lot of static for his use of features on this album. There’s no shortage of criticism that these days, regardless of whether it’s Lil Baby, SZA, J. Cole, or Yeat, Drake gets washed up with his features. While there may be some truth in that, I feel like that’s heavily overexaggerated and largely just a function of disagreements of with Drake’s style. Specifically his “zoned out” feel that makes him seem like he doesn’t want to be in a studio.</p>

<h2 id="defending-the-sound-">Defending the Sound (?)</h2>

<p>Has nobody ever picked up that maybe he does this intentionally or that this frankly fits his lyrics more? Drake <em>doesn’t</em> need to be here. He doesn’t <em>need</em> to compete with current rap forerunners like Yeat, Lil Baby, or whoever else – he’s truly in a league of his own, rivaling widely recognized artists like Taylor Swift. As he said on <em>First Person Shooter</em>, he’s just short of Michael (Jordan). Not to mention that Drake quite literally has been doing this for perhaps too long? Few rappers are able to maintain prevalence for a couple of years, let alone decades. It should come as no surprise then that he needs a break.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-consistency">A Note On Consistency</h2>

<p>Drake is consistent in two ways: 1) creating music that sounds the same and 2) doing #1 over years. Few artists have maintained his consistency as he has done. Is this a good excuse for a B music-point average, compared to other artists with higher peaks? I would say it’s not entirely devoid of merit, but not to be overly celebrated either.</p>

<p>Of course, ideally Drake would be consistent in just creating sounds with a new song. But that’s not realistic.</p>

<p>And on an ending note, that drawing may have been his best album cover.</p>

    <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p>Lately, I’ve been thinking about different forms of media. More specifically, the differences between movies, books, and music.</p>

<p>All of them vary in terms in the time we spend understanding them, with music by far taking the least. In ~3ish minutes, we hear a song full of rhetorical devices &amp; references only to skip past it. In contrast, we spend hours analyzing the written word for meaning in literature classes – even when those words are a transcription of audio. The fact that just because something is intangible – sound – leads to its perceived lack of meaning is astounding.</p>

<p>In any song, an eternity is present. Similarly to how a story can liberally extend across years, decades, or even lifetimes - so do songs. Rarely does a mainstream song seem to be conveying a moment in the few minutes it is listened to. The lack of ability to hit pause (literally) causes a gap in our understandig of this crucial media through which thousands of stories are shared.</p>

<p>Some websites do a decent job of analyzing meaning, notably Genius. Regardless, the level of attention (or lack thereof) paid to songs of the 21st century leaves me concerned on whether such pieces of art will persist through generations. It can be argued that monumental works like <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> has survived in no small part due to its passage in high-school/college education; will not the same occur for the music we listen to today on the radio? Music from the past has persisted through centuries (think Beethoven, Mozart), will not the same be true for today’s Drake/21 Savage/Rihanna/YMCB? It may feel absurd to even suggest a comparison between the two artists, but then again artists often gain the respect they deserve <em>after</em> they are long gone.</p>

<p>To be clear, I am not advocating for not listening to songs back to back, or switching radio stations, etc. Instead I am asking for higher academic attention placed on the music media of today.</p>

      <a href="https://anish.lakkapragada.com/thinking/2023/09/08/bruh/"> Our World, In Distributions </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2023</span>

    <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p>Flat-earthers have been debating for a long time about whether the earth is flat. And while a nearly unanimous conclusion has been met, I dare say that our earth is not just flat or round. Our world is a distribution. More precisely, many of them.</p>

<h2 id="we--data">We = Data</h2>

<p>Every single process of our life contributes to a distribution. When I go to the Tea Top store, the boba I buy is added to the distribution of customers, of customers from Lynbrook High School, of customers from Miller Middle School, of customers from San Jose, you get the point. The time when I wake up is added to an number of distributions as well.</p>

<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>

<p>So, what’s the significance of this? This year I will be applying to college &amp; graduating high school. As I take my AP exams this upcoming May or graduate, I will be contributing to a distribution(s) that thousands of high schoolers have gone through.</p>

<p>In other words, this process is not unusual. So how much of my life, from 8am to 2am when I’m awake, is? As much as mathematicians and computer scientists like low standard deviations &amp; “big data”, isn’t it boring to consistently be lumped with thousands, to be denied individuality? Are we trapped to the distributions that not-so-subtly tell us that, yes, we are unoriginal?</p>

<h2 id="change-makers">Change-makers</h2>

<p>Instead, make a distribution. Or refine an existing one.</p>

<p><em>Change-makers</em> in our world are those who either a) create distributions and/or b) add significant data to existing distributions and/or c) shift existing distributions. When Jobs invented the iPhone, he expanded the existing distribution of hand-held iPhones, shifted the distribution of the most valued company, and created distributions for touch-screen phones. Same applies for anybody whose ever created users to a product. Making change is about making current models of the world inadequate.</p>

<h2 id="ending">Ending</h2>

<p>In statistics, the standard deviation formula \(\sigma(x) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x[i] - \mu)^2}{N - 1}}\) contains a pesky \(N - 1\). This is there to prevent creating distributions modeling one datapoint (\(N = 1\).) So instead of creating, refining, or shifting a distribution - try to be that <strong>1</strong> living outside of it all.</p>

      <a href="https://anish.lakkapragada.com/songs/2023/08/18/trophies/"> Trophies by Drake </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2023</span>

    <p>Besides <em>Club Paradise</em>, another one of Drake’s best (old) songs I want to revisit is <em>Trophies</em>. In accordance to the rules of analyzing these songs, I’ve not visited any pages on the lyrical meaning and will do so at the end after I give it my shot.</p>

<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>

<p><em>Trophies</em> seems to tell the story of Drake defending himself in front of his enemies by claiming that he is an instrumental figure to outsiders (remember this song was made 9 years ago) like him.</p>

<p>In particular, the song begins with brags (e.g. he doesn’t own, he rents) from Drake meant to establish clearly to the listener that he is beefing with somebody. In case by four lines this is unclear, he clarifies that this song is “not a love song.”</p>

<p>The tune changes as Drake goes from brags to being vulnerable with his enemies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Damn, what’s the move? <br />
Can I tell truth? <br />
If I was doing this for you <br />
Then I have nothing left to prove, nah <br />
This for me, though <br />
I’m just tryna stay alive and take care of my people <br />
And they don’t have no award for that <br />
Trophies, trophies <br />
And they don’t have no award for that <br />
Shit don’t come with trophies <br />
Ain’t no envelopes to open <br />
I just do it ‘cause I’m ‘sposed to</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drake here is explaining how his performance is purportedly not to impress anyone, as (through yet another brag) he has already done so, but to show what’s possible for “my people” (most likely referring to those from Toronto?). He repeats the fact that there are no trophies for taking care of others, as if he needs <a href="https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/686541504/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&amp;width=1200">any more</a>.</p>

<p>While it’s unclear if Drake in this verse embodies a man vs. society conflict, it seems more likely than a man vs. man conflict as I cannot see any clear references to others when he says “boys” in the brags that begin the song.</p>

<p>The song repeats a second time, and then ends.</p>

<h2 id="was-i-right">Was I right?</h2>

<p>As is custom, I’ll check my interpretation with Genius.</p>

<p>Genius cannot find any specific people Drake is referring to in this song. Drake’s vulnerable segment about not proving himself to others does not seem directed to anybody and is connected to the general idea that at this time he is basically undisputed #1. All the other references Genius finds are for his brag verse.</p>

<p>That’s all!</p>

    <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p>Here’s a list of philosophies to go over. Mostly just so I remember what they mean.</p>

<h2 id="solipsism">Solipsism</h2>

<p>We will never know if we see the world in the same way. Meaning, are our colors the same? My pink could be your green and your green could be my pink. Do we really taste food the same way?</p>

<p>In short, beyond ourselves, we can’t really think further about what is real. We all mutually agree that the leaves are green, but what if it’s objectively blue but we all say that it’s green because green to us is blue.</p>

<p>This is where science comes into play. While wavelengths do exist to scientifically explain different colors or pH scales measuring acidity - I’m reminded of the dragon in <em>Grendel</em> reprimanding humans for overgeneralization of observations made in an inconsequential amount of time. Like a 2D-seeing deer that can’t recognize the car approaching it, we could be failing to recognize that these easily distinguishable properties between the colors of leaves or tastes of food comes from the simplicity of a 3D view of a potentially ∞-d world. In other words, everything could be an illusion.</p>

<p>What we only know to be true is that we exist and our perception of reality. That’s <em>solipsism</em>.</p>
