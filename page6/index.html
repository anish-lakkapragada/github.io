      <a href="https://anish.lakkapragada.com/theoretical/2022/10/11/gradient-descent-euler/"> Gradient Descent Revisited As Euler's Method </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2022</span>

    <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p><strong>Keywords: Gradient Descent, Euler’s Method, Differential Equation</strong></p>

<p>I’ve already talked a fair amount about Gradient Descent. One of the most fascinating things about Gradient Descent is the amount of ways in which it secretly packs calculus concepts together. Aside from the fact that it literally uses <em>gradient</em>s, or partial derivatives, gradient descent is also derived from a <a href="2022-09-27-mltaylorseries%20copy.markdown">Taylor Series</a> which I’ve detailed before. Today I’d like to detail Gradient Descent in further detail as actually an application of Euler’s Method.</p>

<h2 id="gradient-descent-as-a-differential-equation">Gradient Descent as a Differential Equation</h2>

<p>As a refresher Gradient Descent is:</p>

\[\theta_{t} = \theta_{t - 1} - \alpha\nabla_{\theta_{t - 1}} J\]

<p>Unlike with the Taylor Series article, this time we will be keeping the learning rate \(\alpha\) into consideration.</p>

<p>Gradient Descent can actually be summarized as this Differential Equation.</p>

\[\dfrac{∂\theta_{t}}{∂t} = -\alpha \dfrac{∂J(\theta_{t})}{∂\theta_{t}}\]

<p>This differential equation is obviously unsolvable. A common way of approximating a function when an unsolvable differential equation is given is to use Euler’s method.</p>

<h2 id="primer-on-eulers-method">Primer on Euler’s Method</h2>

<p>Euler’s Method is a way to approximate any function’s value giving an initial starting point and it’s differential equation. For the given \(y(0)=0\) and unsolvable differential equation \(\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \lvert x \rvert\), we can solve for \(y(2)\) by choosing a set number of iterations \(n\) and working our approximation up.</p>

<p>So for example if we want to do only 2 iterations, we would increase \(x\) by 1 each time. The step to first calculate \(y(1)\) is shown below.</p>

\[y(1) \approx y(0) + \Delta x*y'(0)\]

<p>where in this case \(y'(0)\) would represent the derivative of \(y\) at \(x=0\) and \(\Delta x\) gives the change in x (which in our case is 1). This would give us an approximation of \(y(1) \approx 0\).</p>

<p>We could redo this one more time and get \(y(2) \approx y(1) + y'(1)\), yielding \(y(2) \approx 1\). Of course this approximation is not accurate - however as the stepsize \(\Delta x\) approaches to 0 the approximations will get more accurate but there will be a lot more iterations. Hey, with gradient descent they always say a lower learning rate of \(\alpha\) does better but requires more iterations – I sense some very big similarities.</p>

<h2 id="gradient-descent-conclusion">Gradient Descent Conclusion</h2>

<p>Let’s look at our algo again - gradient descent is given by \(\theta_{t} = \theta_{t - 1} - \alpha\nabla_{\theta_{t - 1}} J\), thus we can see that it is basically euler’s method with a step size of \(\alpha\), however done in reverse (hence the negative in the step size.)</p>

<p>Yet another perspective on how to view Gradient Descent. More to come.</p>

<p>For the last year, I’ve gone outside and taken photos of specifically birds (yes those things) in my backyard, neighborhood, and local parks and forests. It’s pretty fun and one of the bird things I’ve always wanted to do is to maintain a list of all the bird’s I’ve photographed (the second is to make a tier list).</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: Taylor Series, Calculus, Gradient Descent, Polynomial Regression, Theoretical ML</strong></p>

<p>This article hopes to provide an alternate look at some of the most foundational algorithms in machine learning, namely Gradient Descent and Polynomial Regression, from an angle of Taylor Series.
Taylor Series are an extremely nice approximation method from calculus and are actually quite common in machine learning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Machine Learning is about creating functions to model (i.e. approximate) functions in data - Taylor series is about approximating functions as well; it should come as no suprise that they are related in many cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="taylor-series-primer">Taylor Series Primer</h2>

<p>So, what are taylor series? I won’t go into the proof here, because I don’t remember it and I don’t think its required, but the main detail is that Taylor Series are a way to approximate any function \(f(x)\) at a given point \(c\) using an infinite sum of polynomials. It’s formula is shown below:</p>

\[f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty f^{(n)}(c)\frac{(x-c)^n}{n!} = f(c) + f^{(1)}(c)(x-c) + \dfrac{f^{(2)}(c)(x-c)^2}{2} + \ldots\]

<p>Where \(f^{(n)}(c)\) represents the \(n\)-th derivative (or just \(f(c)\) if \(n\) is 0), at a point of \(x=c\). Above, we only explicitly show the summation up to the second degree term - if we were to remove the other terms \(\ldots\), we would be left with the <em>second-degree approximation</em> of \(f(x)\). Using finite approximations of a taylor series will become important later, as infinite summations are not always possible in a computer.</p>

<p>On with the examples!</p>

<h2 id="taylor-series-in-gradient-descent">Taylor Series in Gradient Descent</h2>

<p><em>Before reading about the usage of Taylor Series in gradient descent, keep in mind that many different calculus concepts (not just taylor series!) play into gradient descent.</em></p>

<p>Gradient Descent is an iterative algorithm to generally optimize some function overtime based on its gradient (vector of partial derivatives.) The gradient yields a vector that tells the fastest way to ascend a curve - with gradient <em>descent</em> you try to go <em>down</em> the curve and thus constantly move in the negative of this gradient (moving with the positive is called gradient ascent). Gradient Descent is shown below.</p>

\[\theta_{t} = \theta_{t - 1} - \alpha * \nabla_{\theta_{t - 1}} J\]

<p>For more clarification, \(\theta_{t}\) are the parameters of the model (gradient descent is model agnostic, so this could range from linear regression to GPT-3) at a timestep \(t\) and \(\nabla_{\theta_{t - 1}} J\) represents the gradient of the objective function \(J\) that we are trying to minimize. It’s not shown, but \(J\) takes in the parameters \(x, y\) and \(\theta\).  As stated, we move in the direction of the negative of the gradient. \(\alpha\) is the learning rate and is applied to scale the gradient and prevent too high movements.</p>

<p>Gradient Descent can be re-thought of as finding some value \(\Delta \theta\) to adjust \(\theta_{t - 1}\) at each iteration \(t\) such that \(J(\theta_{t - 1} + \Delta \theta)\) is less than \(J(\theta_{t - 1})\). This is where taylor series come in - they help us find this required change. The taylor series to approximate the new value of the objective function to the first-degree is shown below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disclaimer: My linear algebra and multivariable calculus skills are kinda DNE, so please don’t try to inspect every term and make sure that the shapes all match up (probably missing a transpose here and there). Instead try to built intuition of the general approach.</p>
</blockquote>

\[J(\theta_{t - 1} + \Delta \theta) \approx J(\theta_{t - 1}) + \nabla_{\theta_{t - 1}} J * \Delta \theta\]

<p>This is a bit confusing, so let’s clarify, in this case the \(x\) in the approximation of \(f(x)\) is actually \(\theta_{t - 1} + \Delta \theta\) and thus the taylor series is centered at a point \(c\) of \(\theta_{t - 1}\). This means that the first-degree term \(x - c\) actually equals just \(\Delta \theta\).</p>

<p>This is where it gets clever. Given that we set \(J(\theta_{t - 1})\) or \(J(\theta_{t - 1} + \Delta \theta)\) to be less than \(J(\theta_{t - 1})\), to make both sides of the approximation equal, we basically need to find a way to balance the right and left side by reducing \(J(\theta_{t - 1})\) with negatives from the first-degree expression (\(\nabla_{\theta_{t - 1}} J * \Delta\theta\)) to it. We could just set \(\Delta \theta\) to \(-1\), but because \(\nabla_{\theta_{t - 1}} J\) is a matrix - there is no guarantee that all of the numbers inside of it will necessarily be the same sign. Thus we need to find some value of \(\Delta \theta\) that will make \(\nabla_{\theta_{t - 1}} J\) ALL negative.</p>

<p>This is actually much easier than expected. Just set \(\Delta \theta\) to the <em>negative</em> of \(\nabla_{\theta_{t - 1}} J\) and we guarantee all elements are negative (as a gradient squared yields all positive values.) This leads to the approximation having any chance of balancing out. As we add more degrees to the taylor polynomial, this approximation would keep on getting better.</p>

<p>This means that in our (minimization) algorithm of Gradient Descent, with \(\alpha\) for stability, we have:</p>

\[\theta_{t} = \theta_{t - 1} + \Delta \theta_{t - 1} = \theta_{t - 1} - \alpha * \nabla_{\theta_{t - 1}} J\]

<p>That’s gradient descent!</p>

<p>A lot of this information was taken from <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall18/cos597G/lecnotes/lecture3.pdf">here</a> and summarized here. We can expand this method to actually include second and third derivatives as well - but those aren’t used as much due to requiring more computational power (sorry for the explanation that literally <em>everyone</em> gives.)</p>

<h2 id="taylor-series-in-polynomial-regression">Taylor Series in Polynomial Regression</h2>

<p>Weeee that was a lot of work for gradient descent! Luckily, applications of taylor series in polynomial regression is much more straightforward.</p>

<p>Polynomial regression is basically a type of linear regression where a single input (let’s stick to one-dimensional input for simplicity) is raised to higher powers and then the appropriate coefficients are found. The prediction function for a two-degree polynomial regression is shown below.</p>

\[\hat{y} = h(x) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + \beta_{2}x^{2}\]

<p>As shown above, \(\hat{y}\) are the predictions and \(\beta_{n}\) are the coefficients for \(x\) raised to the \(n\)-th power. Already looks like a taylor series (or maclaurin series as \(c = 0\)) right?</p>

<p>In fact, it is! It’s that simple. Let’s see if this actually works in practice.</p>

<h3 id="empirical-experiment-with-exponentials">Empirical Experiment with Exponentials</h3>

<p>Alliteration, huh? Okay, so the famous taylor series of the function \(e^{x}\) is shown below.</p>

\[e^{x} = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \dfrac{x^{n}}{n!} = 1 + x + \dfrac{x^{2}}{2} + \ldots\]

<p>Will Polynomial Regression (to a degree of 2) actually learn this specific taylor series? To reiterate, if I train a Linear Regression model with <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html">scikit-learn</a>’s in Python, that takes in \(x\) and \(x^{2}\) as input - will it learn \({1, 1, 0.5}\) as \(\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}, \beta\_{2}\) respectively?</p>

<p>Will this taylor series be learned, from an algorithm derived from taylor series 🤯 ?</p>

<p>Looks like it won’t.</p>

<p>My hypothesis is that if you use a higher-degree approximation (and of course have much more data), it will be more likely the coefficients will slowly fall in line with the <em>true</em> taylor polynomial. In our case, given that it only had a sample of \(e^{x}\) and not the whole infinite set of values, it is to be expected that not the precise values were found as these values actually could have minimized the mean-squared error more for this specific training set \(X\).</p>

<p>Also, if Polynomial Regression is a taylor series polynomial then linear regression is a first-degree taylor series?</p>

<h2 id="review">Review</h2>

<p>Congrats on making it here!</p>

<p>Taylor Series are a great way to approximate any function into polynomials. They have a lot of hidden applications in machine learning mathematics. We went over their role in helping determine how to move iteratively in Gradient Descent and it’s very clear application to Polynomial Regression.</p>

<p>Please let me know what more theoretical machine learning applications you find! Thanks for reading.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Sep 2022</span>

<p><strong>Keywords: Pareto’s Principle, 80/20 rule, Distribution of Outcomes, Applications</strong></p>

<p>A while ago (more like 4 years ago) I discovered Pareto’s principle - also known as the 80/20 rule - which states that’s 80% of outputs result from 20% of the inputs. Less abstractly, this means that 20% of the input to anything, such as time or effort, will lead to 80% of the actual outputs. For example, only 20% of the features on Microsoft Word will actually be used by 80% of the users whereas the remaining 80% of the features will be used by 20% of the users.</p>

<p>Pareto’s distribution is stunningly applicable. 80% of the crimes are commited by 20% of registered criminals, and 80% of a business’s wealth comes from only 20% of the clients. 20% of the apps on your phone likely are used 80% of the time. This distribution does not need to be exactly 80/20; in some cases it can even go down to 95/5 or even 99/1 (e.g. distribution of wealth across population).</p>

<p>So, how can we use Pareto’s principle in our daily lives? Internalizing the exponential nature in our lives is probably the best way to implement it. If we want a 90 on a test, we’ll only need to put in about half of the effort and time studying compared to getting a 97+. The same goes for standardizing testing; scores are gradually harder to get at the top. Keeping in mind the 80/20 rule can help us decide when the extra mile is excessive or essential.</p>

<p>So now we’ve gone over the how and what - only the <em>why</em> remains. Any ideas on why our world and outcomes are distributed this way? My guess is that the underlying reason of the 80/20 rule is disparity and inequity - one group having much more extreme outliers that overpower all others. The world is moving at an <a href="https://www.su.org/blog/thriving-in-an-exponential-world-and-making-a-difference-doing-so">exponential rate</a>; the most successful stocks (which are extremes in themselves) almost always follow exponential curves as compared to linear ascents. Moore’s law literally forecasts that the number of transistors on a microchip double every 2 years; it’s no secret that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change">we also think the world is constantly growing faster</a> than it ever has before. In short, Pareto’s principle seems to be very common when disparity or a gap grows uncontrollably. In our world, that’s not too uncommon.</p>

      <a href="https://anish.lakkapragada.com/coding/2022/09/21/sveltevreact/"> Yet Another Comparison of Svelte & React </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2022</span>

    <p><strong>Keywords: Reactive Frameworks, Svelte, React, JavaScript</strong></p>

<p>About a year ago, I was introduced to the ever-evolving frontend world where JavaScript frameworks keep on <a href="https://dayssincelastjavascriptframework.com/">getting released every single day</a> and would like to share my comparison on two frameworks I’ve worked with the most. In no way am I an expert on either of these frameworks, but I think it’s a healthy exercise for me to understand them better by drawing a comparison between them.</p>

<p>React is a framework brought to us by Facebook and is widely considered the most popular JavaScript frontend framework there is. Svelte meanwhile is a relatively new framework introduced by Rich Harris, a journalist for the New York Times, focused on developing small-scale, light web applications. As far as Stack Overflow surveys go, there is an interesting split between them - while React is the most <em>wanted</em> framework, Svelte is the most <em>loved</em> framework among current developers. Based on my experience thus far, I kind of can see why that is. More on that later. For now, here are the major differences that I felt.</p>

<h2 id="1-usestate-in-react-sucks">1. useState() in React Sucks</h2>

<p>This is probably the biggest thing I can think about between React and Svelte. In Svelte, whenever you have a reactive variable you want to change (which also is used in rendering for-loops or conditionals), you just change it. Just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo = "bar"</code> and you are done!</p>

<p>In React, though, a clunky state management solution is provided, where you have to first initialize the default value with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">useState(default)</code> and then use the provided functions (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setFoo</code>) to update your variables instead of assignment (as aforementioned for Svelte.)</p>

<p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/twvap8pq9fg91.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bd1e81563e26210644561038b221d25b481bc23" /></p>

<p>Because I started out with Svelte and then React, I forget so many times (often for 2 hours at a time) that I can’t just use assignment and instead need to go with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">useState</code>. Considering React is older than Svelte, it is somewhat expected that Svelte would have the edge on this one.</p>

<h2 id="2-react-styling">2. React Styling</h2>

<p>In React, you can either attach another stylesheet or you can use inline styles (in JSON) to the individual components themselves. This is likely just personal preference, but I find it annoying to have to link each component to another css file (~2x more files that way), or to use inline styles.</p>

<p>Compared to this, Svelte offers either using inline styling or separate styles in the same file as your HTML the same way as vanilla HTML. This is one of the examples where Svelte demonstrates its ridiculously low learning curve.</p>

<h2 id="3-performance">3. Performance</h2>

<p>React is said to treat your model as a blackbox and calculate the difference between what is currently on the page and what should be on the page in a theoretical DOM known as the virtual DOM. Svelte, on the other hand, takes the approach of not using the virtual DOM and instead compiling components at build in a way where the code will take care of whatever rendering changes need to take place. This has been noted to make Svelte have the edge in performance; the Svelte website goes as far as saying the idea that the vDOM makes applications faster is a <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead">“suprising resilient meme”</a>.</p>

<p>The main idea stated by Svelte is that even if the DOM is slow, adding another vDOM will only make things slower as the native DOM will eventually have to be changed. Furthermore, they point that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">useState</code> function in React can in some cases lead to parts of applications rerendering even when not needed.</p>

<p>For fairness, I’ve only really argued for Svelte thus far (and based pretty closely on their own article.) However, other sources also confirm this and the fact that Svelte is <a href="https://massivepixel.io/blog/svelte-vs-react/">nearly 26x more lightweight compared to React</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4-popularity">4. Popularity</h2>

<p>It would be foolish to discard popularity in this discussion. React, hands down, has more popularity. Svelte has 62K stars, React has almost 200K and has been used in plenty of websites.</p>

<p>Thus, it follows that when it comes to UI libraries and other community open-source tools React likely will have much better support.</p>

<h2 id="final-remarks">Final Remarks</h2>

<p>Both Svelte and React are decent frameworks with intended uses. Given the popularity difference,Svelte makes sense to be primarily for much smaller stuff, whereas React is for building larger websites.</p>

<p>Back to what I was saying about the most <em>wanted</em> vs. most <em>loved</em>. Thus far, I still prefer Svelte to React. It’s extremely similar to raw HTML/CSS/JS and takes basically no effort to learn (very easy learning curve.) In fact, I think it’s easier to learn Svelte first than it is to learn HTML and JS first. However, despite me loving Svelte, I felt that I needed to learn React to collaborate with others on projects, such as the current project to build a coding competition website and grading server for our school’s computer science club with 3-4 other devs.</p>

<p>While React isn’t as good as Svelte for me, it isn’t terrible and <em>it’s allowing bigger collaborations with more people. After all, that probably matters more.</em></p>
