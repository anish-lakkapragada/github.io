This is an idea that's been swirling for probably over an year now. Certain words seem to be extremely linked to other words. In other words (get the pun?), using one word almost always will forecase the next word. Now, this is not the obvious cases like using "of" in the blank after "States" in "United States __"; this is more the cases of using *diem* after *carpe* or almost always using "water" after "bread." 

Think of it as a probability question. Given some word X, what word will follow. Here are a few examples below. 

"Give me some bread and ____." 

"I just need to put on my suit and ____." 

"That sweet and ___ taste is amazing." 

"Who are you guys, Adam and ___?"

Those were pretty simple right? It wasn't like you've memorized these pairs. 

But you have learned them. In fact, this actually has a special name of being a **collocation.** Collocations are words that are commonly said in one way and not reversed. You wouldn't say "cons and pros" or "butter and bread", now would you? 

However, collocations are only one type of such word association where one or two words can effectively predict the next word. Another example would be "____ your bets" being hedge. Those aren't necessary pairs but effectively operate the same way through repetition of hearing what others say. 

So why do these word pairs exist? My hypothesis is that constant repetition of these words ingrains these patterns. Beyond repetition, sometimes there is only one way to express a concise idea, and thus we rely on a certain verb or not for certain expressions. This is a well documented phenomenon - certain languages can expresses concepts that other languages can't.
