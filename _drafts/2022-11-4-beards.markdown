I've been trying to grow a beard recently. NNN was never an option for me so I guess we're doing No Shave November instead. 

THe only problem tho is that the beard is extremely itchy. Like unbearably itchy. It groes in patches, is extremely rough. Worst of all, there's no visible gain - it sometimes just plateaus it height. 

After trying to admire my fake beard while putting in my contacts, I realized an interesting fact - not all the beard hairs ("sharp pokes") actually point the same direction. They all have the same general direction but point individually in different directions. For some reason, this reminds me of slope fields. You can actually trace paths with the beard hairs in a certain direction.
