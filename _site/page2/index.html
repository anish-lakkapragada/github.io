    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2023</span>

    <p>One of my favorite time wasters is reading song lyrics to understand what they mean. After all, we do the same for literature - analyzing things up to the colon - so maybe doing the same for well-thought music is not a bad idea.</p>

<p>The first song I’d like to try this with is Drake’s reflective song <em>Club Paradise</em> as part of the Care Package album. Keep in mind that at the end of this article I’ll confirm with more reliable sources (cough cough <em>Genius</em> cough cough) about whether I got the meaning correct - so don’t hyperventilate if I completely mis close read.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lyrics to <em>Club Paradise</em> can be found <a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/drake/clubparadise.html">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="story-line">Story Line</h2>

<p><em>Club Paradise</em> tells the story of Drake having left his hometown (Toronto) wanting to come back to a home that doesn’t accept him anymore. Although not specifically stated, there are strong allusions to Drake being seen as disconnected from who he was due to how he seems “caught up in where [he is] right now.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“No wonder I feel awkward at this Fashion Week”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drake denies allegations that he’s changed from his original hometown persona by taking shots at all the fancy things he secretly (or now, publicly) can’t stand - notably Fashion Week or how to formally do a double-cheek kiss. He even goes so far as to defend his realness by the very fact that he knows the names of performers at a gentleman’s club.</p>

<p>Throughout the song, he asks the same question about <em>“who did he leave behind”</em>. My guess is that this is a reference to who Drake has not publicly acknowledged has helped him or not given anything back to in return. He’s desperate for reassurance that he <em>is</em> still the same person, as shown in the lines below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Yeah, just lie to my ears. Tell me it feel the same, that’s all I’ve been dying to hear”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next part of the story confirms his identity crisis even more. Even his mom considers him a <em>“slave to the wealth”</em>. He explains that he’s never failed to achieve anything but is still vulnerable and most importantly needs love.</p>

<p>Overall, this is one of Drake’s better tracks which indicates why it’s probably less listened to (this is real.) The level of introspection present is insane.</p>

<h2 id="did-i-get-it-correct">Did I get it correct?</h2>

<p>As promised, I would check with smarter sources if I missed anything.</p>

<p>This was an easy song to look at it, so there’s not a ton of discrepancies between what I found and Genius. Mostly I couldn’t recognize the subtle indications that Drake doesn’t intend to change based on his performance, and instead maintain the same sound. <em>Club Paradise</em> is actually not a tribute to the 1986 movie but to Drake’s favorite gentleman’s club.</p>

<p>More songs coming! <em>MELTDOWN</em> next?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have managed to not post anything here for a whole month. :&lt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every night, I am challenged with the question of whether to keep on watching videos on YouTube that I know I’ll forget by the next morning or whether not to sleep. As a big fan of psuedomathematics - mathematics applied in the least non-rigorous setting for the most fun possible - I’m going to try to apply that here. I’ll go over in the end why pseudomathematics is (maybe?) not a complete waste of time.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Assuming everything in your life is predetermined (big assumption, I know) - we can assume the functions of \(life(t)\) or \(l(t)\) is set. This function will return your set of experiences \(e\) each of which can be evaluated for a happiness score \(H(e(t))\) and a memorability score \(M(e(t))\). For now, let’s assume that \(e(t)\) is a vector-valued function with values that are interpretable in the same way of a latent space. The first element of this vector is the time at which this experience starts. Given this, the total happiness in your life \(Q\) from \(t=0\) to time \(T\) over a total of \(E\) experiences</p>

\[Q(T) = \sum_{i=1}^{E} M(e_{i}) * H(e_{i})\]

<p>or with cheesy calculus,</p>

\[Q(T) = \int_{t=0}^{T} M(l(t)) * H(l(t)) dt\]

<p>But we are not done yet! Keep in mind that the memorability \(M(e(t))\) and its happiness \(H(e(t))\) will actually vary throughout your life. An event may be forgotten about but then remembered, or may seem happy at first but then become sad. Not to mention both \(M\) and \(H\) are probably correlated, which we can ignore to make things simpler. For now, let’s revise the calculation of happiness to be for a single experience.</p>

\[Q(e_{i}, T) = \int_{t=e_{i}[0]}^{T} m_{i}(t) * h_{i}(t) dt\]

<p>where the \(i\)th event will have it’s own memorability and happiness functions for each second - \(m_{i}(t)\) and \(h_{i}(t)\) respectively. Because “life is nothing more than experiences” we can just sum up the experiences given by \(l(t)\) at each second.</p>

\[Q(t) = \int_{t=0}^{T} Q(l(t), T)dt = \int_{t=0}^{T} [\int_{s=t}^{s=T} m_{i}(t) * h_{i}(t) * ds] * dt\]

<p>This also means the change of your happiness every second is given by</p>

\[Q'(t)= \int_{t}^{T} m_{i}(t) h_{i}(t) dt\]

<p>Of course this can all be repeated for pain/sadness, which we’ll just assume is the negative of happiness here. But the basic tradeoff of memorability vs. happiness is still there.</p>

<h2 id="back-to-the-question">Back to the Question</h2>

<p>So basically this view of happiness leaves a question of whether its better to have higher happiness and less memorability or vice versa. We’ll look at each case before translating our rationale to math.</p>

<h3 id="case-1">Case 1</h3>

<p>A situation with higher happiness and less memorability looks like an overworked hedge fund manager choosing to have a year long vacation (at its extreme).</p>

<h3 id="case-2">Case 2</h3>

<p>The most extreme example of living with no memorability but constant happiness would be partying every single day, watching YouTube every single day, not working a mundane job, etc.</p>

<p>The goal of contemplating this is to understand the behavior of the functions \(m(t)\) and \(h(t)\). Which scenario seems better? Of course, I think most people would choose Case 1 - the common argument would be that Case 2 is aimless and vainful. Both memorability &amp; happiness of a given experience \(i\) decay past that event’s starting time.</p>

<p>It’s also imperative to remember that given the current mathematical formulation, we are trying to maximize happiness greedily as we are only looking at \(Q(t)\) of the current time and not considering long-term effects. This sways much more heavily to case 2 - that happiness leaves slower than memorability.</p>

<p>This actually, does make sense. When going to a restuarant and eating a dish we’ve never seen before we will likely only remember a few things - 2 minutes of conversation, the first time we saw our food, etc. Happiness of eating the dish when we are hungry would last a little longer.</p>

<p>Therefore, I think it’s fair to say that because memorability of an experience after its start date is naturally focused on non-mundane points (beginning, end) whereas happiness of an experience seems to last longer we can rationale that happiness of an event dies down at a lesser power than memorability. Even further, because memorability focused on specific points (1-2% of the actual lifetime), that means that \(m(t)\) is very likely 0. Therefore, counterintuitively we should be optimize memorability over happiness.</p>

<h2 id="back-to-problem-again">Back to Problem Again</h2>

<p>Because \(m(t)\) is going to be 0 a lot more than \(h(t)\), we need to increase \(m(t)\) as much as possible to make \(h(t)\) actually mean something. Therefore uniqueness of experience and variety matters more than feel-good indulgence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop watching YouTube at 4am lol.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-use-pseudomath">Why use Pseudomath</h2>

<p>What I just did is a horrible way to solve a problem.</p>

<p>Pseudomath is a continual reminder that math can’t solve <em>all</em> our toughest problems. Problems so hard a book didn’t come with them. Furthermore, if I had not used pseudomath how would I have thought about the tradeoffs of memorability and happiness? Maybe I would have instead said optimizing happiness is better because we only have one life, or that we don’t forget the happy moments in our life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Writing this at 4:40am after a day of 3 AP exams. Slept too early.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been thinking about whether exams make someone a better person. They are stressful. They can corrupt a love for learning.</p>

<p>But they also teach dealing with a stress in a relatively low-pressure, stable environment. The task at hand is extremely well defined, sometimes you are even given a guide to prepare, and nothing (no monetary outcomes) are at risk if you fail. However, for a job - high-stakes situations arise without warnings, unstructured, and can be mired in political capital problems. Thus, are exams the training wheels for adolescents to deal with these times later?</p>

<p>Furthermore, in these exams those who either studied the most, were the smartest, or cheated typically do best. It may feel discouraging to see those who barely studied get an A compared when you worked much harder. Again, not a good reason to &lt;3 exams. But isn’t this also realistic of how performance goes in the career “real-world”?</p>

<p>So to go back to this (argumentative essay) prompt - no, exams don’t make you a better person. Or I could argue that (for me at least), taking hard exams (and doing well on them) does make me more confident to take on harder, stressful challenges. But an <em>N=1</em> sample is too small to generalize, so I’m going to stick for no today.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that exams are preparation of something more in a heavily controlled environment. And I think it’s going to be a long-time until we can evaluate a person’s skills in a situation that doesn’t involve an exam (e.g. reading their brain flows and chemicals) as accurately. So might as well try to frame tests as something nice for the interim time.</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>A lot of times in our life, we reflect more on what isn’t going well and not what is. It may feel like everything fails at the worst moment - however, we rarely acknowledge all the things that did go well, or by contrast worked and did not succeed. For example, during a test we will underestimate how many we got wrong because we spent so much more time on questions we didn’t know the answer to. Part of this makes sense though - we expect staples to staples in them, computers to charge when we plug them in, and phones to work (we expect things to work.)</p>

<p>In light of this idea of <em>gratitude</em>, one idea I had was to keep a rolling list of all the things I’ve seen that have luckily gone in a favorable direction. That way, I’ll pay more attention to what is working than just what isn’t.</p>

<p><em>I know I have not maintained this thing. That is not due to AP exams but laziness.</em></p>

<p>One thing that’s been on my mind for a while now is why the internet has taken form in the way that it has. Why is United States the country with the highest GDP? Why did they choose a different shade of blue and typeface for different parts of the chapstick container that will be not noticed by 99% of users? Why am I born at this station of status in the world?</p>

<p>Too often, we don’t don’t ask enough questions. There’s a lack of questioning of why the world acts in the way it does and why it arrived at this specific state out of an infinite amount. I’m pretty sure this is because in such a highly structured and organized society, we don’t realize the bigger picture that the single planet we are engrossed in comprises of man-made concepts. The world is deterministic to some extent. I can’t find the eraser at school because I forgot it. It’s not in multiple positions as we may think, it’s in one.</p>

<p>There’s so much for us to question. The Pacific Ocean isn’t real, country lines are imaginary, money has no intrinsic value. So much of the prejudice around us in baseless and crumbles under reasoning of “WHY”? How have humans been able to create fake illusions that now are considered as real as the earth itself? In our origins where we could die at any minute, why do we celebrate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_effect">birthdays</a> - are we proud to survive another year or cheering away the fact that we are closer to our death :skull:?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alan Kay: “The Internet was done so well that most people think of it as a natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something that was man-made”</p>

<p>Furthermore, is pondering the current state of the world even worth it? If scientists are correctly, we are one in infinite parallel universes - just a <em>permutation</em> of what could have occurred over the span of all time. Why debilitate over whether we need to change when life is getting better (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190111-seven-reasons-why-the-world-is-improving">overall</a>)? If our world’s state, configuration, policies, whatever is just one in an infinite amount - is it even important?</p>

<p>But if it’s the only one in this shape - can we not also conclude with a 0% p-value that this configuration is sacred in a way? Like, the trajectory of how the world evolves that we are part of is significant (maybe the best, the worst, or some other distinguisher)? With a infinite amount of paths to take, is the road that we have taken special?</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about this especially after reading <em>Grendel</em> for my school’s APLAC class. In <em>Grendel</em>, the rich dragon criticizes the beast at his ignorance of the world. In particular, he mentions that the fact a certain object (e.g. a jug) has been repeatedly made proves its inherent value; after all it was that particular configuration of atoms (from an infinite set) repeated many times that shows it’s too significant to ignore. Similarly, our policies &amp; ideas may be significant, holy decisions as we continue to practice the same rules again and again, like monetary and fiscal policy.</p>

<p>Nobody knows.</p>
