<p><strong>Keywords: Interesting, Random</strong></p>

<p>This is an idea that’s been swirling for probably over an year now. Certain words seem to be extremely linked to other words. In other words, a word will almost always be preceeded by a word or a group of words before it. Now, this is not the obvious cases like using “of” in the blank after “States” in “United States __”; this is more the cases of using almost always using “water” after “bread” but not using vice versa.</p>

<p>Think of it as a fill-in-the blank challenge. Given some word or sets of word, what word will follow. Here are a few examples below.</p>

<p>“Give me some bread and ____.”</p>

<p>“I just need to put on my suit and ____.”</p>

<p>“That sweet and ____ taste is amazing.”</p>

<p>“Who are you guys, Adam and ____?”</p>

<p>Those were pretty simple right? It wasn’t like you’ve memorized these pairs.</p>

<p>But you have learned them. In fact, this actually has a special name of being a <strong>collocation.</strong> Collocations are words that are commonly said in one way and not reversed. You wouldn’t say “cons and pros” or “butter and bread”, now would you?</p>

<p>However, collocations are only one type of such word association where one or two words can effectively predict the next word. Another example would be the blank in “____ your bets” being “hedge”. Those aren’t necessary groups of words, as “protect”, “safeguard”, and “derisk” all would work, but basically work the same as collocation pairs.</p>

<p>The main point of showing these examples is to demonstrate that we actually don’t think about what we are going to say in terms of singular words but instead in terms of concepts/ideas/blocks. Beyond proper nouns, a simple proof of this is that we (well, most of us) can’t understand why we need the word “the”, instead of something like “a”, in the phrase “In <em>the</em> interest of time”, but naturally say the phrase.</p>

<p>Predicting one word in a sentence from what has already is a miracle and a super interesting task that we do on a daily basis. Here are a few more to enjoy :)</p>

<p>“Oh for ____’s sake, do the dishes!”</p>

<p>“If ____ permits, we can show a demo at the end.”</p>

<p>“That moment absolutely crushed my ____ in humanity.”</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: Random</strong></p>

<p>I’ve used LaTex for writing some stuff (check my <a href="/notes">notes</a> lmao). In fact, if you’ve read some of the other articles here, you’ve seen latex before. It’s what allows me to render equations like:</p>

\[L^{a}t^{e}x = p\_{r}^{e} \int ect\]

<p>Latex <em>is</em> perfect. Why does it look so good and feel so good to write?</p>

<h2 id="code-like-writing">Code-like writing.</h2>

<p>With latex, you still feel like you are coding while you are writing. It’s set with it’s own set of commands like \int for a nice \(\int\) or \begin{section} to start a new section of an article. Hell, you are even writing inside of a project with all the other files. You are literally <strong>compiling</strong> the files. Need I say more? This makes you feel cool and productive compared to writing words on an MLA formatted Google Document for an in-class APLAC essay 💀</p>

<h2 id="consistency-in-rendering">Consistency in Rendering</h2>

<p>LaTex always looks the same. You can count on its section headers to look the same, and you know that when you request a bibliography for you it will be automatically alphabetized. You can write an equation, move it to another section, and it will look the same.</p>

<h2 id="style">Style</h2>

<p>Style is a weird thing to describe. Aesthethic is an even worse word to use, because that makes it just more abstract. But I guess the best way to describe LaTex in three words is professional, clean, and precise. The LaTex Rendering never fails to produce the cleanest font. It makes me feel like I’m a real scientist who knows what they’re doing.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-latex">How to Use Latex</h2>

<p>Just create another project on <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a> and that’s it. Our you can select an arXiv preprint and start from there.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: Aubrey Drake Graham, Falling <del>Back</del> Off, Random</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This post is for pseudo-informational purposes and entertainment only.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So by this point, you’ve probably heard of Drake. He’s the guy who gave us the infamous Hotline bling meme, the most amount of <em>Billboard</em> Music Awards, and easily over a hundred grammies. Needless to say, he is a big deal.</p>

<p>However, a lot of people have argued that his music has been steadily declining for the last five years since 2015. I wouldn’t go to that extent, but there is some truth in the fact that I find myself listening to a lot more of his past songs than his current songs. Maybe that’s a problem within rap itself, but for current rap music - Migos, 21 Savage, Juice WRLD (RIP) - I find myself listening to 2017-2019 songs compared to Drake - where I frequently go as back as 2011-2013.</p>

<p>Ironically, Headlines - easily one of Drake’s best songs - has this line in it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had someone tell me I fell off, ouh I needed that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet somehow, still so many feel he fell off.</p>

<h2 id="the-good-drakes-best">The Good: Drake’s Best</h2>

<p>Let’s start of with the good. Drake for sure has plentiful good songs - after all, you don’t enjoy success without some talent.</p>

<p>A list of (my opinion ofc) Drake’s best songs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Headlines</em> (<strong>2011</strong>)</li>
  <li><em>Marvin’s Room</em> (<strong>2011</strong>)</li>
  <li><em>Energy</em> (<strong>2015</strong>)</li>
  <li><em>Forever</em> (<strong>2009</strong>)</li>
  <li><em>Too Good</em> (<strong>2016</strong>)</li>
  <li><em>Do Not Disturb</em> (2017)</li>
  <li><em>Fake Love</em> (2017)</li>
  <li><em>Worst Behavior</em> (<strong>2013</strong>)</li>
  <li><em>From Time</em> (<strong>2013</strong>)</li>
  <li><em>Take Care</em> (<strong>2011</strong>)</li>
  <li><em>Hold On, We’re Going Home</em> (<strong>2013</strong>)</li>
  <li><em>Pound Cake + Paris Morton 2</em> (<strong>2013</strong>)</li>
  <li><em>A Keeper</em> (<strong>2022</strong>)</li>
  <li><em>Sticky</em> (2022)</li>
  <li><em>Portland</em> (2017)</li>
  <li><em>Falling Back</em> (2022)</li>
</ul>

<p><sup><sub>I didn’t bold the 2017 songs, even though that’s five years ago!</sub></sup></p>

<p>You might be suprised by the last two. I do think those are decent songs by Drake in the future, and promising of perhaps a new wave of talent. Same goes with his featured verse on <em>Churchill Downs</em> - his verse was good to the point where videos have arised of his section only.</p>

<p>But from the list, I think it’s clear for the most part we’re 5 years past his prime.</p>

<h2 id="why-the-downfall">Why the downfall?</h2>

<p>I’m not really experienced in Drake or analyzing celebrities, but I think based on my preliminary research it mostly comes down to the lack of originality and high predictability.</p>

<p>Lot of people criticize for Drake not trying since his albums <em>Views From the Six</em>. Since then, he has released infamous albums <em>Certified Love Boy</em> and <em>Honestly, Nevermind</em>. Aside from <em>Falling Back</em> or <em>Sticky</em>, neither really had that great songs compared to his past. CLB in particular has been described as having boring beats and using a monotone, tuned out voice. This is in contrast to his past songs like <em>Marvin’s Room</em> and <em>Headlines</em> which had more complex tunes and beats. <em>Worst Behavior</em> and <em>Energy</em> both also demonstrate a good use of a passionate voice than something with a tuned-out voice like <em>Girls Want Girls</em>. While the argument could be made that there is just a natural appreciation for loud, energetic sounds, a lack of diversity in an album is never a pro. Maybe this is just a meta point about rap songs by artists these days than anything else.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-to-be-expected">Is this to be expected?</h2>

<p>To some extent, yes. The pressure of being a star is insurmountable and expecting consistent hits is unreasonable. But, artists like Kendrick Lamar have delivered consistently creative songs. People wouldn’t place this much attention to Drake’s supposed downfall if they didn’t believe he couldn’t do better.</p>

<p>This is the conclusion of this rant. Don’t take anything here seriously.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:4000/theoretical/2022/10/11/gradient-descent-euler/"> Gradient Descent Revisited As Euler's Method </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2022</span>

    <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p><strong>Keywords: Gradient Descent, Euler’s Method, Differential Equation</strong></p>

<p>I’ve already talked a fair amount about Gradient Descent. One of the most fascinating things about Gradient Descent is the amount of ways in which it secretly packs calculus concepts together. Aside from the fact that it literally uses <em>gradient</em>s, or partial derivatives, gradient descent is also derived from a <a href="2022-09-27-mltaylorseries%20copy.markdown">Taylor Series</a> which I’ve detailed before. Today I’d like to detail Gradient Descent in further detail as actually an application of Euler’s Method.</p>

<h2 id="gradient-descent-as-a-differential-equation">Gradient Descent as a Differential Equation</h2>

<p>As a refresher Gradient Descent is:</p>

\[\theta*{t} = \theta*{t - 1} - \alpha\nabla*{\theta*{t - 1}} J\]

<p>Unlike with the Taylor Series article, this time we will be keeping the learning rate \(\alpha\) into consideration.</p>

<p>Gradient Descent can actually be summarized as this Differential Equation.</p>

\[\dfrac{∂\theta*{t}}{∂t} = -\alpha \dfrac{∂J(\theta*{t})}{∂\theta\_{t}}\]

<p>This differential equation is obviously unsolvable. A common way of approximating a function when an unsolvable differential equation is given is to use Euler’s method.</p>

<h2 id="primer-on-eulers-method">Primer on Euler’s Method</h2>

<p>Euler’s Method is a way to approximate any function’s value giving an initial starting point and it’s differential equation. For the given \(y(0)=0\) and unsolvable differential equation \(\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \lvert x \rvert\), we can solve for \(y(2)\) by choosing a set number of iterations \(n\) and working our approximation up.</p>

<p>So for example if we want to do only 2 iterations, we would increase \(x\) by 1 each time. The step to first calculate \(y(1)\) is shown below.</p>

\[y(1) \approx y(0) + \Delta x*y'(0)\]

<p>where in this case \(y'(0)\) would represent the derivative of \(y\) at \(x=0\) and \(\Delta x\) gives the change in x (which in our case is 1). This would give us an approximation of \(y(1) \approx 0\).</p>

<p>We could redo this one more time and get \(y(2) \approx y(1) + y'(1)\), yielding \(y(2) \approx 1\). Of course this approximation is not accurate - however as the stepsize \(\Delta x\) approaches to 0 the approximations will get more accurate but there will be a lot more iterations. Hey, with gradient descent they always say a lower learning rate of \(\alpha\) does better but requires more iterations – I sense some very big similarities.</p>

<h2 id="gradient-descent-conclusion">Gradient Descent Conclusion</h2>

<p>Let’s look at our algo again - gradient descent is given by \(\theta*{t} = \theta*{t - 1} - \alpha\nabla*{\theta*{t - 1}} J\), thus we can see that it is basically euler’s method with a step size of \(\alpha\), however done in reverse (hence the negative in the step size.)</p>

<p>Yet another perspective on how to view Gradient Descent. More to come.</p>
