<p><em>I know I have not maintained this thing. That is not due to AP exams but laziness.</em></p>

<p>One thing that’s been on my mind for a while now is why the internet has taken form in the way that it has. Why is United States the country with the highest GDP? Why did they choose a different shade of blue and typeface for different parts of the chapstick container that will be not noticed by 99% of users? Why am I born at this station of status in the world?</p>

<p>Too often, we don’t don’t ask enough questions. There’s a lack of questioning of why the world acts in the way it does and why it arrived at this specific state out of an infinite amount. I’m pretty sure this is because in such a highly structured and organized society, we don’t realize the bigger picture that the single planet we are engrossed in comprises of man-made concepts. The world is deterministic to some extent. I can’t find the eraser at school because I forgot it. It’s not in multiple positions as we may think, it’s in one.</p>

<p>There’s so much for us to question. The Pacific Ocean isn’t real, country lines are imaginary, money has no intrinsic value. So much of the prejudice around us in baseless and crumbles under reasoning of “WHY”? How have humans been able to create fake illusions that now are considered as real as the earth itself? In our origins where we could die at any minute, why do we celebrate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_effect">birthdays</a> - are we proud to survive another year or cheering away the fact that we are closer to our death :skull:?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alan Kay: “The Internet was done so well that most people think of it as a natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something that was man-made”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, is pondering the current state of the world even worth it? If scientists are correctly, we are one in infinite parallel universes - just a <em>permutation</em> of what could have occurred over the span of all time. Why debilitate over whether we need to change when life is getting better (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190111-seven-reasons-why-the-world-is-improving">overall</a>)? If our world’s state, configuration, policies, whatever is just one in an infinite amount - is it even important?</p>

<p>But if it’s the only one in this shape - can we not also conclude with a 0% p-value that this configuration is sacred in a way? Like, the trajectory of how the world evolves that we are part of is significant (maybe the best, the worst, or some other distinguisher)? With a infinite amount of paths to take, is the road that we have taken special?</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about this especially after reading <em>Grendel</em> for my school’s APLAC class. In <em>Grendel</em>, the rich dragon criticizes the beast at his ignorance of the world. In particular, he mentions that the fact a certain object (e.g. a jug) has been repeatedly made proves its inherent value; after all it was that particular configuration of atoms (from an infinite set) repeated many times that shows it’s too significant to ignore. Similarly, our policies &amp; ideas may be significant, holy decisions as we continue to practice the same rules again and again, like monetary and fiscal policy.</p>

<p>Nobody knows.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2023</span>

<blockquote>
  <p>Writing this with a C in APLAC lmao. Now a B. Now an A. lmao.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our school recently encountered a power outage where we got a good amount time off from school. When the announcement came, I was surprised to see how prevalent the belief that students-must-hate-school stuck (I am somewhat guilty of this, but in my defense it meant I didn’t have a quiz tomorrow). Everybody cheered because there was less school, as if the fact that school was bad was dogma and self-evident. Well, I don’t hate school and thus here this <del>💩post</del> goes.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-people">Meeting People</h2>

<p>No, the first reason is not learning. I am not that corny/predictable (for now).</p>

<p>Despite the striking lack of diversity my 90% Asian high school has, there’s a good amount of varied attitudes and people. It’s not hard to find math nerds five feet away from students blasting music and playing spikeball. As part of going to school, I enjoy chance interactions/conversations and making as many jokes, however degenerate, as possible. Collaborations &amp; opportunities all come from exposure to people outside your “bubble” - I find you only (or at least for me) get that from talking to different people. Futhermore, it’s always interesting to learn about people and what they spend their time on precisely because sometimes I could never imagine myself doing what they do. I will sometimes even pretend that a door is not open just to start a conversation with whoever will open it 💀.</p>

<p>These chance conversations literally whenever - during class, passing periods, walking to and from school - are already a good enough why to go to school. Regardless of how much sleep I got the last night, meeting new faces who eventually become friends makes school worth it.</p>

<h2 id="shared-suffering">Shared Suffering</h2>

<p>OK, so I’ve been talking about how I like school but now state that in it we <em>suffer</em>? Let me elucidate (as my english teacher says).</p>

<p>Getting screwed week after week with hard tests in tough classes, as far as I’ve seen, generally brings people together. I’ve noticed that the hardest classes usually create the best bonds as everybody tries to prepare for the upcoming test. I would argue that is part of the reason that students actually enjoy harder classes than those easier (assuming it works out for them). For some reason it can be embarrassing to admit, but we do like learning.</p>

<h2 id="generally-useful-information">Generally Useful Information?</h2>

<p>Starting with a quick disclaimer that I am in awkward position to praise the American public education school system as a student at a high school ranked in the top 100 in the US and top 10 in California.</p>

<p>But as far as I have seen, most of the information we learn in school is NOT useless. Gaining a broad foundation across disciplines is valuable at an age (&lt;20) where it cannot be expected (in first-world countries) that we should know what we want to dedicate time to. I do think there is value in being able to understand the world around us, which school addresses somewhat completely - how the world formed around us (history), provable truths about our world (sciences), what our world &amp; collective psyche is based on (language classes). It’s <em>not</em> bad.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I’d say most students would happily take two weeks off from school if given the choice but then secretly want to return in a month or so. Would anybody ask to restart school? Idk.</p>

<p><del>It’s been a minute since I’ve updated this thing.</del> Today I woke up with a pretty fun dream. I found a secret part of my high school filled with California Scrub-Jays (my favorite bird :D) and rushed to take photographs of them. On that note, why not write an article on my observations and techniques for photographing birds ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<h2 id="common-reason-for-failed-photographs">Common Reason for Failed Photographs</h2>

<p>Leaves. Branches. More leaves. Half the time these things become the area of focus for my camera lens instead of the fast-moving birds I am going to capture. Therefore, always try to find a clearing or area where no leaves/branches are in front of the bird (in the background as scenery is not a problem).</p>

<p>Another common reason for a bird photograph is cause the bird flies off. Here’s how to avoid that.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-the-bird-from-flying-off">How To Prevent The Bird From Flying Off</h2>

<p>To some extent, the motions of a bird are out of control. However, simple things like not talking near the bird or not making too loud steps are controllable. Only approach a still bird further <em>after</em> taking a photograph of it. It doesn’t make sense to give up your guaranteed picture in hopes of a more close-up picture.</p>

<p>Avoid shaking the branches of the bird either as that tends to make the birds go away. Of course, this stuff all sounds obvious but I’m not lying when I say there is a spidey sense to know when a bird will disappear a split-second before it happens.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-bird-photograph">What makes a good bird photograph?</h2>

<p>I’m not the best in photographing these creatures but the main thing I’ve noticed is that having the face (and both eyes) is extremely crucial. We look at bird photographs somewhat in the same way as humans. Having as much focus on the bird’s face - and the emotion created by the bird’s hopeful glance as it turns its head - is extremely important.</p>

<h2 id="why-bird-photography-is-enjoyable">Why Bird Photography is Enjoyable</h2>

<p>Bird photography (at least for an amateur like me) is a little bit like monopoly. There’s undeniable skill, but undeniable luck as well. Sometimes I get multiple of my best photographs ever from one trip (Alaska 👀) and sometimes return borderline empty-handed. But there are things to improve upon - better aim of the camera, the ability to recognize birds faster, being able to shift lens focus in a split-second, knowing which birds show when - there is a reason we have photographs like <a href="https://images.theoutdoorwire.com/2019/12/04/45d848cc-63f8-43ae-8692-f47e960cfc54_600x476.jpg">these</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore observing birds as they hop around free while you stress about APLAC is oddly annoying and reassuring at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It’s not as boring as it sounds. Also peep the amateur <a href="/notes/bay-area-birds-field-guide.pdf">field guide</a> I made for Bay Area birds.</p>

    </h1>

<p>Having ~1.5 years of experience with napping, I think I have am pro enough to have some insights. In fact, I just took a 10min nap at 12:00 (pm!) so that I could get myself to study electric potential &amp; voltage. Naps are typically taken wrong but are also pretty dangerous if you don’t take them right. Here’s to everything I know about naps on 2/23/2023 at 2:14am.</p>

<h1 id="benefits">Benefits</h1>

<h2 id="energy-saver">Energy Saver</h2>

<p>The rationale for taking a nap is the idea of admitting that you will not be productive if you do not take a nap. For example, after arriving from school I am pretty certain I will not immediately do homework and instead just browse YouTube. If on average I estimate I will waste 20 minutes of watching YouTube, which not only will drain my energy by being on a scren but also lose motivation to get through homework without watching YouTube - it makes no sense to avoid YouTube altogether. Instead, taking a 20-30 minute nap is ideal for productivity. By accepting that you need a break as an inevitable, taking a nap means not only that you get that break but that break actually will lead to increased focus/motivation/patience for BS after you wakeup. It’s sort of like making a contract like I’m going to kill X minutes but will immediately be productive after. In reality, it’s worth sacrificing 20-30 minutes for 30minutes of work at 95% productivity compared to 15 minutes of YouTube at 50-75% productivity levels.</p>

<h2 id="day-breaker">Day Breaker</h2>

<p>Naps, especially those of 20-30min taken in the afternoon after something intensive like school, allow for the brain to shut down. This essentially means that after waking up from the nap, memory of what happened before the nap will suffer. Thus, what you just did an hour ago in school will seem distant and somewhat feel like a completely different day. Also, if you are a “morning person” (inceased productivity after waking up) - ig waking up more in a day can only be useful then?? Or instead you like sleeping/dreaming (or the feeling of normal force supporting your side), naps can give you a way to sleep more with the pretense of “productivity”. I’ve had a good amount of times when while napping I feel like I am awake with eyes open - it’s always pretty fun.</p>

<h2 id="escape-from-reality">Escape from Reality</h2>

<p>Naps are a great way to escape your problems.</p>

<h2 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2>

<p>Naps can really screw you up. For one, if you lack self-control and extend your nap to more than 1 hour, your basically screwing up the time when your body will want you to sleep. Second, I guess people feel unproductive taking naps or something? I guess you just have to really believe that 20min of dead time outweighs switching back-and-forth tabs with distractions for 30min of work.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: Random</strong></p>

  <p>This article was made at 2am. I will update as I become more aware of my own observations and discover more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s been a while since I’ve posted and I figure I should. I’ve made a series of observations in my life which are undoubtedly true (I may be biased ;) but generally seem to prove themselves true time and time again. Whether that is a self-fulfilling prophecy of me believing in my own BS, I do not know.</p>

<h2 id="experiences-can-not-be-repeated-twice">Experiences Can Not Be Repeated Twice</h2>

<p>I remember when I was younger, visiting a beach in Europe. It was pretty fun to be in the waves and all day. The next day, I wanted to have exactly what I had yesterday - a nice day on the sand - but the tides were going crazy and the weather was cloudy and gloomy. From that experience in itself around ~7 years ago, I’ve come to realize that any memory cannot be repeated more than once. Time is a monotonically increasing function - you cannot go back - to the first time you listented to your favorite song, read your favorite book, or had a genuinely good time.</p>

<p>What this implies is the idea of <em>living in the moment</em> as being necessary to experience life better. If we are having a fun, spontaneous time, we have to be smart enough to realize that 1) we are having fun and that 2) this time will never come again in its pure, natural form and thus the best thing that can be done is to make it the best time of it. While in the moment we are just living - just like we always are - and thus we don’t see the moment’s importance (e.g. importance of spontantenously going out or looking around), it’s important to see every second of this moment will be valuable in the future. Memories <em>appreciate</em> in value over time, so make the best investments with what time you have now.</p>

<p>If this seems too idealistic for you, here’s a simpler one - just next time you find a song that hits your ears in a nice way just try to listen to that song only because the pleasure you get from its novelties, unexpected beats, etc. will die with each listen.</p>

<h2 id="useful-vs-useless-arguments">Useful vs. Useless Arguments</h2>

<p>Today, I remember seeing an argument about who was the most oppressed/privileged/etc. demographic throughout history. This may seem obvious, but regardless of how won - there would be no real winner because they are really just fighting for approval over an opinion not over policy. Useless arguments argue over opinions, useful arguments argue over policy. Try to aim for useful arguments.</p>

<h2 id="implicit-order-of-the-world">Implicit Order of the World</h2>

<p>For this mysterious thing called <em>prestige</em>, there seems to be an implicit order of the world. The world is full of diverse people yet at the same time follows predictable, statistically-significant patterns en masse: students offered a selection of universities generally choose some over others, certain countries are seen as just “better” (e.g. America) despite growing bodies of evidence saying anything but. Rankings for companies change yearly and yet the same implicit order of which companies are more prestigious stay - there is a general inertia for learnt rankings to change when they are founded on unstated social assumptions and not facts.</p>

<h2 id="things-are-more-deterministic-than-we-realize">Things are more deterministic than we realize</h2>

<p>My desk right now is an absolute mess. It is completely disorganized and there are random pens everywhere. I can’t even tell you how I got to this state. But it is deterministc. When I search for something, like a pen, that I will inevitably lose in this mess, I can guarantee I will try to search for multiple different locations. This is fine, but it’s better for me to realize there’s a reason why it’s the place it is beyond the fact that I “lost” it.</p>

<p>Decisions are not made in a vaccuum; they are not random. There is a reason why the U.S. sides with Israel or why India today may be reluctant to condemn Russia in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The current standing of things - be it where my history notes went or a country’s foreign relations - can logically be retraced to their initial states.</p>

<p>The principle that things are the way they are for a reason (deterministic in machine learning) is an interesting one.</p>

<h2 id="your-music-taste-is-not-really-unique">Your Music Taste Is Not (Really) Unique</h2>

<p>(Might just be me.) I am always hungry about songs. It is always super funny to see how an unfamiliar song with a slightly weird name but a lot of streams slowly goes from something I completely don’t resonate or feel is part of my taste to my playlist. Time and time again, I have seen that whatever my initial reaction to the song - <em>I am not unique</em> - I probably will find myself liking it. This means that I should try to explore different genres and not judge.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-always-closer-to-the-end">You Are Always Closer to the End</h2>

<p>Basically, I have noticed more than likely there is always some way to frame your current timeframe in which you are at the end of the proces. During the summer, I will be near the end of high school. Right now, I am one day away from the last day of school. At the start of second semester in senior year, I am towards the end of the year (and the end of high-school.) At the start of first semester in senior year, I am towards the end of the college application process (and nearing the end of the year.) There is always an end in sight!</p>
