<blockquote>
  <p>This article was made at 2am. I will update as I become more aware of my own observations and discover more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s been a while since I’ve posted and I figure I should. I’ve made a series of observations in my life which are undoubtedly true (I may be biased ;) but generally seem to prove themselves true time and time again. Whether that is a self-fulfilling prophecy of me believing in my own BS, I do not know.</p>

<h2 id="experiences-can-not-be-repeated-twice">Experiences Can Not Be Repeated Twice</h2>

<p>I remember when I was younger, visiting a beach in Europe. It was pretty fun to be in the waves and all day. The next day, I wanted to have exactly what I had yesterday - a nice day on the sand - but the tides were going crazy and the weather was cloudy and gloomy. From that experience in itself around ~7 years ago, I’ve come to realize that any memory cannot be repeated more than once. Time is a monotonically increasing function - you cannot go back - to the first time you listented to your favorite song, read your favorite book, or had a genuinely good time.</p>

<p>What this implies is the idea of <em>living in the moment</em> as being necessary to experience life better. If we are having a fun, spontaneous time, we have to be smart enough to realize that 1) we are having fun and that 2) this time will never come again in its pure, natural form and thus the best thing that can be done is to make it the best time of it. While in the moment we are just living - just like we always are - and thus we don’t see the moment’s importance (e.g. importance of spontantenously going out or looking around), it’s important to see every second of this moment will be valuable in the future. Memories <em>appreciate</em> in value over time, so make the best investments with what time you have now.</p>

<p>If this seems too idealistic for you, here’s a simpler one - just next time you find a song that hits your ears in a nice way just try to listen to that song only because the pleasure you get from its novelties, unexpected beats, etc. will die with each listen.</p>

<h2 id="useful-vs-useless-arguments">Useful vs. Useless Arguments</h2>

<p>Today, I remember seeing an argument about who was the most oppressed/privileged/etc. demographic throughout history. This may seem obvious, but regardless of how won - there would be no real winner because they are really just fighting for approval over an opinion not over policy. Useless arguments argue over opinions, useful arguments argue over policy. Try to aim for useful arguments.</p>

<h2 id="implicit-order-of-the-world">Implicit Order of the World</h2>

<p>For this mysterious thing called <em>prestige</em>, there seems to be an implicit order of the world. The world is full of diverse people yet at the same time follows predictable, statistically-significant patterns en masse: students offered a selection of universities generally choose some over others, certain countries are seen as just “better” (e.g. America) despite growing bodies of evidence saying anything but. Rankings for companies change yearly and yet the same implicit order of which companies are more prestigious stay - there is a general inertia for learnt rankings to change when they are founded on unstated social assumptions and not facts.</p>

<h2 id="things-are-more-deterministic-than-we-realize">Things are more deterministic than we realize</h2>

<p>My desk right now is an absolute mess. It is completely disorganized and there are random pens everywhere. I can’t even tell you how I got to this state. But it is deterministc. When I search for something, like a pen, that I will inevitably lose in this mess, I can guarantee I will try to search for multiple different locations. This is fine, but it’s better for me to realize there’s a reason why it’s the place it is beyond the fact that I “lost” it.</p>

<p>Decisions are not made in a vaccuum; they are not random. There is a reason why the U.S. sides with Israel or why India today may be reluctant to condemn Russia in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The current standing of things - be it where my history notes went or a country’s foreign relations - can logically be retraced to their initial states.</p>

<p>The principle that things are the way they are for a reason (deterministic in machine learning) is an interesting one.</p>

<h2 id="your-music-taste-is-not-really-unique">Your Music Taste Is Not (Really) Unique</h2>

<p>(Might just be me.) I am always hungry about songs. It is always super funny to see how an unfamiliar song with a slightly weird name but a lot of streams slowly goes from something I completely don’t resonate or feel is part of my taste to my playlist. Time and time again, I have seen that whatever my initial reaction to the song - <em>I am not unique</em> - I probably will find myself liking it. This means that I should try to explore different genres and not judge.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-always-closer-to-the-end">You Are Always Closer to the End</h2>

<p>Basically, I have noticed more than likely there is always some way to frame your current timeframe in which you are at the end of the proces. During the summer, I will be near the end of high school. Right now, I am one day away from the last day of school. At the start of second semester in senior year, I am towards the end of the year (and the end of high-school.) At the start of first semester in senior year, I am towards the end of the college application process (and nearing the end of the year.) There is always an end in sight!</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: Random</strong></p>

<p>Basically, at some point or another we’ve probably heard of the saying <em>count your stars</em> or <em>be happy with what you have</em>. I recently learned about hedonistic treadmills and made me make a (probably not unique) connection to this saying. For those, unaware the <em>hedonistic treadmill</em> refers to the stability of one’s happiness regardless of events of positive and unhappy occurences. Essentially, the principle of the hedonistic treadmill says that after a positive or a negative event, we will feel some slight delta in happiness only to return back to where we were before. This is not to say that our happiness is the same regardless of our lives - improvements in living conditions of course improve happiness (generally) - but is more so to describe the fact that we are generally pretty stable.</p>

<p>Before we get to the adage in the title, it’s worth noting that the hedonistic treadmill (at least how I see it) is great at proving another adage about the journey and not the destination. By the hedonistic treadmill, if we wanted to maximize our happiness (like this is some sort of differentiable function idk?) working in jobs and progressing careers would be pretty irrelevant. However, many people find satisfaction from achieving their goals, even if they return to the same happiness before: this is pretty good proof that the journey leads to happiness more than the destination. Perhaps this is a higher-form of happiness like meaning or some other self-help buzzword. Ironically, this means that the hedonistic treadmill measuring happiness missed the fact that just traveling on this treadmill makes us happy. Who else is thinking that this type of satisfaction is an integral of the hedonistic treadmill’s sine waves??</p>

<p>I digress, but the returning of a baseline stands. We really can’t change this baseline happiness other than preventing negative events from taking hold and finding more positive events to genuinely celebrate. To do this, I guess it’s best to just be happy with have. I am still curious about its function though.</p>

<p>This article may have been kinda cringe 🙃 :D</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: Backpropgation, Gradient Descent, Theoretical ML</strong></p>

<p>Hope you are enjoying the new year 2023! It’s been a while since I’ve uploaded a theoretical algorithm so here we are :)</p>

<p>I’ve made a few posts and challenges about typical first-order gradient descent that I think it’s time I move on to other aspects of ML. But before I do, here’s one last gradient-descent-ish article on a variant of standard optimization algorithms and my theory on its potential usefulness in generative models.</p>

<p>Double backpropagation was first created by Le Cun and Drucker in 1992 and since then has been widely dismissed (maybe for computational reasons).Introductory ML courses and books don’t even cover it, so perhaps this article will help explain some things.</p>

<h2 id="double-backpropagation-algorithm">Double Backpropagation Algorithm</h2>

<p>The name for double backpropagation is a little weird because it’s not actually backpropagation (basically gradient descent) applied twice but just an addition of another term in the objective function. For an objective function \(J\) to optimize parameters \(\theta\) on a training set \(X\) , the double backpropagation function \(J'\) is given by:</p>

\[J'(\theta) = J(\theta) + \lambda \lVert \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial X} \rVert^{2}\]

<p>It’s actually pretty simple. The new objective function is just the regular objective functive plus the differentiable L2-norm of the gradient of the regular objective function with respect to the input scaled by some <em>hyperparameter</em> (you choose the value) \(\lambda\).</p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Double Backpropagation is motivated by forcing the parameters to be as generalizable as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More concretely, the value of the adjusted function \(J'\) does not care just about the performance of the model with the parameters \(\theta\) but also how stable they are. If the input \(X\) is changed slightly, the model’s performance (objective function \(J\)) should ideally not change much. This is similar to <em>augmentations</em> where we want the predictions (e.g. a cat image predicted as a cat) to be the same regardless of small changes in the input - both double backpropagation + augmentations try to <em>force</em> the model to be generalizable to differing input. This is of course helpful because when a model is deployed, the input the model will encounter may not be similar to the data gathered use for training.</p>

<p>This is why the (partial) derivative in the equation measures the model’s performance (objective function value) sensitivity to small changes in the input \(X\) is added. The algorithm is known as <em>double</em> backpropagation because a <a href="http://luiz.hafemann.ca/libraries/2018/06/22/pytorch-doublebackprop/">gradient of a gradient</a> is utilized.</p>

<h2 id="double-backpropagation-for-smooth-latent-spaces-">Double-Backpropagation for Smooth Latent Spaces (?)</h2>

<p>Just some background here. Generative models (for our purposes) are any type of model which takes in random vector input and generates some novel output. For example, a generative model \(G\) is a function that takes in a random generated vector \(\vec{x}\) and returns an image \(Y\).</p>

<p>Let’s say this generative model is trained through some black-box witchcraft (or a GAN training procedure) to generate images of people through these vectors. In this case, differing vectors will produce different people (e.g. different genders, races, body type, etc.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A latent space is the full extent of values the vector can take, where similar generated images will come from vectors which are near each other in this space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A short aside: one of the most underrated parts about machine learning is its ability to frame an infinite space (e.g. vector input values in a generative model) in a way that makes sense: similar output images are generated with vectors that are close to each other. More impressive, these computers don’t really know the meaning of words or images (they just see numbers) but can formulate a good understanding of the world.</p>

<p>Ideally in these models, the mapping of the input vector \(\vec{x}\) to the image \(Y\) learned by \(G\) is <em>smooth</em> - small changes in \(\vec{x}\) shouldn’t lead to drastic changes in \(Y\). Do you see where I am going with this?</p>

<p><strong>Keywords: Random</strong></p>

<p>Today was the last day of finals for me, and my final final was history. While preparing for it, I realized that there was something I had been thinking about for a good time now but just haven’t got around to writing about.</p>

<h2 id="how-history-is-taught">How History is Taught</h2>

<p>I’m confident the way that history is taught is the reason why so many students don’t enjoy it. We are expected to remember that the vague, narrative events we are reading about were actual deaths, actual soldiers, actual <em>people</em>. We see things as a series of chained events to understand, not an actual event that happened. When we read about the thousands of hands mutilated in the Congo we don’t even flinch, let alone feel the pain for one of our fingers to be removed. It’s not like the shock of assasinations, public statements, or word of mouth has changed for the last two thousands of years; but when we read about them in a sentence we feel nothing. This problem will only persist with history recorded for the 21th century if we let this continue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The headlines of Roe v. Wade or Kanye West’s statements on InfoWars are sensational and beyond real: how would we feel if they just got summarized in a textbook as “The highly influential ruling by the Supreme Court led to radical protests across the country and for some marked the US complacency in progress.” Kinda bland, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it’s too hard for us to even imagine these events as real without tangible proof. After all the worlds we learn about in history, like India’s partition or Chinese dynasties, are not only so physically far away for some of us but also extremely distant in the past. Textbooks only make this worse by condensing this into a very singular narrative of event <em>X</em> leading to War <em>Y</em> which resulted in the Treaty of <em>Z</em>. While many teachers in this generation have done away with memorizing dates for good, the underlying problem of emphasis on events and not experience is a problem.</p>

<p>Even if the problem of history feeling like a straight story to be told is inevitable, it still can be done better. What makes stories interesting to most people is not just the ability to explore a new world (which history by definition can give!) but also its power to make us feel something. History classes should try to make us feel the same thing as the people we are learning about did. The collective <em>psyche</em> of a nation during massive events is more moving than a description and at a level of deeper understanding.</p>

<p>Examples of this “psyche”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>After Columbine, people were frightened to send their children to school and provided them with directions home.</li>
  <li>After Jonestown, people mocked those killed as crazy and hell-driven.</li>
  <li>After 9/11, the America re-evaluated Bush as a serious president and some races tried their best to be hidden.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may have heard the saying “drink the Kool-aid”, but have you listened to the chilling Death Tape hours in Guyana before tragedy?</p>

<h2 id="my-solution-to-teach-history-better">(My) Solution To Teach History Better</h2>

<p>Pretty simple. Use primary source accounts. In fact, just have students read autobiographies like <em>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</em> detailing the experience of a slave or <em>Night</em> by a Holocaust survivor’s time in camp. Factual accounts are often seen as the peripheral or supplementary but that needs to change - textbook events / lectures should only be there to help give a basic way of thinking about the events at the time required to understand primary sources.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my opinion, this marks a shift away from history being about learning what happened in the past to <em>experiencing</em> it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the motivations for learning history we are commonly told is from the famous Santayana quote: ​“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” When we remember books or movies, we don’t remember what happened as much as what we felt when we went through them. History is likely no different: our years of education are numbered (well, for most of us), and if we want our experience in classroom history to be most fruitful for us to be able to cause future change it’s imperative that we remember them as best as possible. Heartstrings pull us into action, not words, and thus since reading first-hand sources is the best way to empathize with struggles in the past, it just may help prevent them from happening again. Otherwise, we are betting that we will remember numbers of tragedy decades later and furthermore, act on them.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Students should be thrilled to learn history. After all, it is the closest thing we have to time travel!</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:4000/random/2022/12/10/beards/"> My Experience Growing a Beard, And Then Shaving It </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Dec 2022</span>

<p>This year, I participated in No Shave November (we don’t talk about how the other \(N^{3}\) went for me.) Almost a week in December, I decided to shave it off. While I have no regrets about shaving it off, I do want to remember what it felt like (without having to wait almost a month.) Hence, this account.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As usual, all advice given here is to be taken with not a grain of salt but a molecule.</p>

<h2 id="preliminary-growth">Preliminary Growth</h2>

<p>I actually only realized I was not shaving in November a few days after when a decent stubble had already appeared. Photo below.</p>

<p>It looked okay, but was pretty itchy and overall pretty annoying. It didn’t form any kind of cohesive shape that was identifiable as a beard: put simply, it just looked like excess hair added on a clean-shaven face. It did get better, but the main thing during this step is to just not shave it nor obsess about it. Admit that it is NOT a beard, but will be soon.</p>

<p>For the most part and did feel discouraged by the slow growth. Luckily, I kept it on because only 4 days later, it was much more full.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tip: Be patient. Why? Not all hair grows at the same rate. <br /> Somebody write a differential equation to model beard growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this kind of a beard with stray hairs and even a little bald spot in the middle of the chin doesn’t look great to say the least, it does feel great. With my clean shaven face right now, I still find myself rubbing my chin hoping to feel the prickly sensation akin to mild acupuncture.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of all the things you can do with a beard:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make Fun of Your Friends Who Can’t Grow One</li>
  <li>Convince yourself you look better with it</li>
  <li>Enjoy the feeling of constant poking on your face (good for winter)</li>
  <li>Feel older</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-beards-suck">When Beards Suck</h2>

<p>Basically, at a certain point in a beard enjoyer’s growth, the beard grows out of control. Hairs start to grow in incongruent directions and some extend farther out from your face than others. In other words, a mess. Furthermore, for me at least, my beard was not closing in all the way.</p>

</figure>

<p>The only good thing at this phase was the mustache. Lowkey wished I just kept the mustache and shaved everything off, but more on that later. Of course, the beard still have the same benefits, but its hideous appearance made it more of “oh, that <em>is</em> a beard” than “damn, that is a beard.”</p>

<p>The only benefit to this was being able to claim that I participated in my skit group project playing Obi-Wan Kenobi by growing a beard.</p>

<p>However, that’s where trimmers come in. They remove excess hair on the sides and make the beard feel like something that was styled instead of accidental. During NSN, I only really did one trim. And it looked pretty fire afterward:</p>

</figure>

<p>Trimming is a lot of work compared to a clean shave, but it is worth it. By far, this was the peak of my beard growth. One of the things before I started growing my (former) beard was just the pure time commitment. It requires basically nothing except dedication and genes for it to grow to a point where it feels good, but for it to look good - much more than clean shaving. I only did one trim because trims take way too long.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Still, grow a beard. At least try to. Decide once the beard is there whether or not you want to trim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only thing with trimming though is to be careful. You could accidentally shave off your entire beard if you use a trimmer not right for your size.</p>

<h2 id="the-post-trim-era">The Post Trim Era</h2>

<p>Post trim, I let the beard do its thing and continuing growing. It once again regressed back to its hideous, unclean shape. I guess you could say a prt of me enjoyed having that unclean hair on my face because of its ability to show to people that I was tired.</p>

<p>The photo above does a pretty good job at demonstrating the effect of the beard. If I was to smile today with my baby face, I would lack the inherent masculine and borderline aggressive vibes that my face used to give off. The effect of this all depends on those who view you, I guess.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-shaved">Why I Shaved</h2>

<p>It’s actually pretty simple. It was already a few days into December, and not only did my mom continously tell me every 5 seconds the beard looked bad, I also had a business pitch coming up in a few weeks.</p>

<p>It mostly changed though when I got this message from a fellow classmate:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/beard-assets/message.png" width="200" />
    <figcaption> <i>The turning point, 12/2</i> </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Within a few days, I had decided to shave. The pressure was insurmountable and most of all, with November in the rearview mirror there was no real reason to keep it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the benefits of the beard are real, the main one is to relive the experience of being clean-shaven the first time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess I knew about this the entire time. The main motivation ever-present in the back of my mind was to have the most satisfying clean shave possible.</p>

<h3 id="some-shaving-advice-dont-be-like-me">Some shaving advice: don’t be like me</h3>

<p>On December 4th, my mom was yelling at me shortly before going to bed about how she would get extremely mad and take my computer if I slept past 1:30am. So, to hopefully make her happy + suprise her, I decided to shave.</p>

<p>However, I was stupid and decided to procrastinate this to after all my work was done which was around 1:40am. Despite watching countless shaving beard videos, my brain decided that I would be able to shave without first using a trimmer and then the razor. When I realized this, I also realized another crucial detail: the trimmer was in another room and I didn’t want to wake her up either.</p>

<p>By the time this astounding insight fell upon me, I had already shaved in some areas of my face. Even worse, the hair was so thick that it essentially clogged up the razor and at times made it unusable. I had to manually remove the hair and continue going at it. It took almost three latherings of shaving cream for it to finally come off. The ensuing result was not pretty.</p>

<p>However, after the shaving was all done, it was arguably one of the best moments of my life. I couldn’t stop smiling and noticing how much cleaner I looked.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-try-it">Conclusion: Try it</h2>

<p>I am still extremely grateful that I did actually try and commit to No Shave November. It felt amazing to venture into unknown territory, that too through only natural growth. My only suggestion is to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>at least try to a beard one for three weeks before making the lame excuse you can’t. Then shave it off and suprise everybody with how good you look.</p>
